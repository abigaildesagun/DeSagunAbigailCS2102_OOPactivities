## Laboratory Activities
#### Laboratory Activity 1
Demonstrates the usage of input/output operations, string manipulation, math functions, explicit type casting, and escape sequences.
- [GettingGreater](https://github.com/abigaildesagun/DeSagunAbigailCS2102_OOPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%201%20-%20%7B06%7D-%7BSeptember%7D-%7B2024%7D/GettingGreater.java): Compares characters from string inputs and determines the greater value based on their ASCII values using a math function.
- [GettingInputs](https://github.com/abigaildesagun/DeSagunAbigailCS2102_OOPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%201%20-%20%7B06%7D-%7BSeptember%7D-%7B2024%7D/GettingInputs.java): Prompts the user for input and displays it using escape sequences for formatting.


#### Laboratory Activity 2
This activity demonstrates the usage of looping statements, functions, and arrays.
- [GetArrayMean](https://github.com/abigaildesagun/DeSagunAbigailCS2102_OOPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%202%20-%20%7B10%7D-%7BOctober%7D-%7B2024%7D/GetArrayMean.java): Uses a looping statement to collect user inputs for the elements of an array and a function containing a looping statement to iterate through the array and calculate the mean of the elements.
- [MultiplicationTable](https://github.com/abigaildesagun/DeSagunAbigailCS2102_OOPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%202%20-%20%7B10%7D-%7BOctober%7D-%7B2024%7D/MultiplicationTable.java): Operates with looping statements, 2D arrays, and functions to populate the array and print it in the format of a multiplication table.

  
#### Laboratory Activity 3
Illustrates the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming.
- [Artist](https://github.com/abigaildesagun/DeSagunAbigailCS2102_OOPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%203%20-%20%7B22%7D-%7BNovember%7D-%7B2024%7D/Artists/Artist.java): A superclass that represents general details about artists, utilizing getters, setters, and constructors to manage and initialize the attributes.
- [Dancer](https://github.com/abigaildesagun/DeSagunAbigailCS2102_OOPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%203%20-%20%7B22%7D-%7BNovember%7D-%7B2024%7D/Artists/Dancer.java), [Painter](https://github.com/abigaildesagun/DeSagunAbigailCS2102_OOPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%203%20-%20%7B22%7D-%7BNovember%7D-%7B2024%7D/Artists/Painter.java), [Singer](https://github.com/abigaildesagun/DeSagunAbigailCS2102_OOPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%203%20-%20%7B22%7D-%7BNovember%7D-%7B2024%7D/Artists/Singer.java), and [Writer](https://github.com/abigaildesagun/DeSagunAbigailCS2102_OOPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%203%20-%20%7B22%7D-%7BNovember%7D-%7B2024%7D/Artists/Writer.java): The subclasses. They incorporate enums and overrides a superclass function to print details tailored to a specific artist and their unique art style.
- [ArtistDemo](https://github.com/abigaildesagun/DeSagunAbigailCS2102_OOPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%203%20-%20%7B22%7D-%7BNovember%7D-%7B2024%7D/Artists/ArtistDemo.java): The main class which demonstrates the concept of initialization.
Note: Ensure that only the classes needed for external access are included in the package, and follow Java's standard for package naming by using **lowercase** formatting.



#### Laboratory Activity 4
Demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming concepts while utilizing interfaces to define and implement shared functionalities across different classes.
- [Shape](https://github.com/abigaildesagun/DeSagunAbigailCS2102_OOPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%204%20-%20%7B28%7D-%7BNovember%7D-%7B2024%7D/Shapes/Shape.java): The interface, which defines three methods that are overridden by multiple implementing classes.
- [Rectangle](https://github.com/abigaildesagun/DeSagunAbigailCS2102_OOPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%204%20-%20%7B28%7D-%7BNovember%7D-%7B2024%7D/Shapes/Rectangle.java), [Square](https://github.com/abigaildesagun/DeSagunAbigailCS2102_OOPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%204%20-%20%7B28%7D-%7BNovember%7D-%7B2024%7D/Shapes/Square.java), and [Triangle](https://github.com/abigaildesagun/DeSagunAbigailCS2102_OOPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%204%20-%20%7B28%7D-%7BNovember%7D-%7B2024%7D/Shapes/Triangle.java): Implements the interface and overrides its methods, with each class providing its own unique implementation.
- [ShapeCollection](https://github.com/abigaildesagun/DeSagunAbigailCS2102_OOPactivities/blob/main/Laboratory%20Activities/Laboratory%20Activity%204%20-%20%7B28%7D-%7BNovember%7D-%7B2024%7D/Shapes/ShapeCollection.java): Utilizes the concept of for-each loop to print the different values of the shapes.
Note: Ensure that only the classes needed for external access are included in the package, and follow Java's standard for package naming by using **lowercase** formatting.

### Instruction for Reviewers
- Each person has their unique coding style. Do not just copy others' code, use it as inspiration to develop your own tailored approach.
- Consistently practice coding to internalize the syntax and make it second nature.

### Purpose
- The activities in this repository are designed to challenge your understanding of Java programming, encouraging not only implementation but also the pursuit of efficient solutions. They also demonstrate the application of core Java programming concepts.
